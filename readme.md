### About

dzianis.dashkevich.us@gmail.com / New York

Experienced Software Engineer with `8+` years of building high-performance, scalable web media applications/players used by _millions_ worldwide.\
A recognized contributor to the video.js ecosystem with deep expertise in streaming protocols (HLS, DASH), DRM, and web player frameworks like video.js, hls.js, dash.js, and Shaka Player. \
I led the development of production-grade playback SDKs for Smart TVs, mobile apps, and the web. \
While web media tech is my core specialty, I bring a generalist mindset — I am comfortable owning features end-to-end, building responsive front-end interfaces and backend APIs, and optimizing CI/CD pipelines. \
Proven ability to adapt quickly, deliver robust solutions across domains, and mentor teammates while fostering engineering excellence.

- Planned and led the development of Web/Smart TV SDK, written in TypeScript, enabling customers to implement media playback across traditional browsers and Smart TVs (Tizen and WebOS).
- Improved Brightcove Player time-to-first-frame metric by an average of 25%.
- Proactively led live debugging sessions and ad-hoc technical meetings with enterprise clients, diagnosing complex issues in real time and driving rapid resolutions.
- Delivered fixes for critical playback issues in a web media player powering over 4 billion streams per month that improved stream stability and preserved revenue for major B2B partners.
- Delivered Google IMA DAI (SSAI) integration within the web player, fulfilling the requirement that was a deal-breaker for several enterprise clients, and directly enabling the closure of multiple high-value contracts.
- Managed Player releases with a canary deployment strategy: A/B testing using in-house analytics piped into the Graphite/Grafana database to detect anomalies only present in production traffic.
- Proposed and authored a formal [RFC](https://github.com/videojs/rfcs/blob/main/proposals/0003-vhs-next.md) for the new playback engine in video.js.
- Actively contributed to the video.js open-source ecosystem [improving core playback features](https://github.com/videojs/http-streaming/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Adzianis-dashkevich+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Acreated-asc) used on over 750,000 websites, starred by 38,000 developers on GitHub.
- Refactored CI/CD pipeline templates in TeamCity to reduce duplication and increase reliability, simplifying the new project setup process and enabling faster, more efficient project launches.
- Developed an automated PR tracking tool aggregating activity across 120+ internal and open-source repositories, prioritizing team-authored contributions and halving code review delays through status labeling and triage.
- Founded and led an internal Web Player Discussion Club, fostering a culture of continuous learning and cross-team knowledge sharing around video tech, playback performance, and web media standards.
